## About me

Hi everyone!
I'm Bruno, graduated in Sanitary and Environmental Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil).

Currently I'm working in an engineering company, where I develop hydrological and hydraulic studies seeking for hydroelectric exploitation.

I've been doing scientific research (as undergrad student) since 2018, what has helped me to glimpse the subjects I like most. Hence, I also work as an independent researcher in the field of Remote Sensing, collaborating with researchers from several institutions.

I enjoy working with QGIS, R and Python (and Google Earth Engine) and I'd really appreciate improving my knowledge on these matters. Is one of the reasons I'm here!
