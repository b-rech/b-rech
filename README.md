## About me

Hi everyone!
I'm Bruno, graduated in Sanitary and Environmental Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil).

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in the Remote Sensing Postgraduate program at the National Institute for Space Research (Brazil). 

I enjoy working with QGIS, R and Python (and Google Earth Engine) and I'd really appreciate improving my knowledge on these matters. Is one of the reasons I'm here!
