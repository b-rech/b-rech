## About me

Hi everyone!
I'm Bruno, undergraduate student in Sanitary and Environmental Engineering at Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil).

I've been doing scientific research (as undergrad student) since 2018, what has helped me to glimpse the subjects I like most.
Currently, my interests include Hydrology and associated things such as Statistics, Data Science and Geographic Information Systems.

I enjoy working with QGIS and R (through RStudio) and I'd really appreciate improving my knowledge on these matters. Is one of the reasons I'm here!
